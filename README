SimpleXmlArchiver README

Check the project wiki on GitHub for the latest info: https://github.com/NLxAROSA/SimpleXmlArchiver/wiki

The interesting class here is SimpleArchiver. It has two methods:

`+(NSString *)objectToXml:(id)objectToEncode;`

This method takes any object tree and serializes it to an autoreleased XML String.

Usage:
`NSString *result = [SimpleArchiver objectToXml:myObjectRef]`

Archive the resulting NSString using NSKeyedArchiver (only one key necessary! :))

`+(id)xmlToObject:(NSString *)xmlString targetClass:(Class)targetClass;`

This method takes the generated XML String and deserializes it back to an instance of the specifed targetClass.

Unarchive the NSString from your archive using NSKeyedUnarchiver, then pass it to the SimpleArchiver like so: `MyObject *myObjectRef = [SimpleArchiver xmlToObject:result]`


# Usage in your own project

1. Add the following to 'Header Search Paths' (Debug is enough): /usr/include/libxml2
2. Add the following to 'Other Linker Flags' (Debug is enough: -lxml2
3. Add the Constants, SimpleArchiver and GDataXMlNode classes to your project
